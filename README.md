## Abstract
### Background
Unusual times call for unusual solutions. Hospital clinicians, an anthropologist and artificial intelligence collective with data scient expertise were united by concern for the COVID-19 pandemic and engaged in an accelerated collaboration an answer the simple question, do lockdowns actually work?

### Methods
The John Hopkins University COVID-19 Disease dataset was used to visualise the impact of a range of societal interventions on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 5 different countries inclusive of the Unites States of America. The time series data set was accessed for visualisation of exponential growth patterns of COVID-19 cases and calculations were made for corresponding doubling time (number of days before case load doubles given growth rate). This was plotted as a time series with societal interventions dates (inclusive of lockdowns) to assess for interruption to the data trend. Qualitative and interrupted time series analysis was applied to look for correlation with changes to the doubling time.

### Results
Lockdown interventions were shown to statistically correlate with an increase in doubling time (p<0.001 for all countries analysed). Other societal interventions appeared to have mixed results that favoured efficacy.

### Conclusions
Our data analysis shows that the introduction of social mitigation measures, especially lockdown measures, can alter the COVID-19 Disease growth trajectory within 14 days. This supports early and aggressive social mitigation interventions to reduce domestic burden of COVID-19 Disease.
