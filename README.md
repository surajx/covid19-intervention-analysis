## Abstract
### Objective:
Social mitigation interventions (SMI), inclusive of lockdown, should intuitively alter the exponential growth
rates of Covid-19 cases. A quasi-experiment design was used to assess the effect of SMI on the doubling time of
Covid-19 cases from six different countries including Australia.

### Design:
The John Hopkins University COVID-19 Disease dataset provided confirmed Covid-19 cases, that was used to
estimate doubling time (number of days for case load to double) given calculated growth rate. Published SMI
dates were acquired from government websites and media organizations. The time series data was annotated with
SMI dates to assess for effect on the doubling time. A 14-day temporal window was applied to ascertain
whether changes occurred within this period. Computer code was used for data extraction and to keep analytics
up-to-date.

### Setting:
John Hopkins University COVID-19 Disease dataset was accessed during the 2019-2020 Covid-19 disease
pandemic.

### Participants:
Data from South Korea, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, the United States of America and Australia was
analysed.

### Main outcome measures:
Statistical significance on the difference between pre-intervention and post-intervention doubling time curves
for the SMI was calculated with an interrupted time series analysis.

### Results:
Lockdown interventions were associated with an increase in doubling time (p<0.001 for all countries analysed)
and occurred within 14 days. Other societal interventions appeared to have mixed results that favoured efficacy.

### Conclusion:
The introduction of SMI, especially lockdown measures, alter the COVID-19 growth trajectory within 14 days.
This supports early and aggressive social mitigation interventions to reduce domestic burden of COVID-19
Disease.
